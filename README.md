# otus-cpp

This repository contains homeworks for Otus C++ course: https://otus.ru/lessons/razrabotchik-cpp/.

Each howework has a separate branch and is deployed to travis-ci.org and bintray.com independently. However, all the branches are merged into master to make navigation easier. Each folder in branch master contains task.pdf file with howework task, some folders contain a helpful README.md.

The final project for the course can be found in another repository: https://github.com/kovdan01/custom-ci-cd/.
